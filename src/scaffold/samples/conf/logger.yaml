# Notes
#
#   An item without a `qualname` will be treated as a root logger provided it
#   is instantiated.  
#   
#   If `logfile`` is not specified, LoggerFactory will attach a console handler.
#
#   `propagate`, a boolean,  will have no effect if the root logger is not
#   instantiated.  It defaults to True, as in the logging package.
#
#   `add_console`, a boolean, is available, and introduces an additional
#    console handler for the given logger.  It defaults to False.

loggers:
- level: WARNING

- qualname: __main__
  level: INFO
  logfile: basic.log
  propagate: False
  add_console: True
